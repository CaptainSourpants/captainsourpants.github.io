<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Captain Sourpants Sourdough Starter</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for your order. Included in this package are detailed instructions to activate your starter and a packet of dehydrated San Francisco sourdough starter</p>
<p><strong>What you need</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A clean glass jar or bowl.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Clean, lukewarm water - For best results, use filtered or spring water.&nbsp;</li>
<li>All-purpose flour</li>
<li>Patience &amp; Love</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Day 1: </strong>Mix &frac12; cup lukewarm water and your package of starter powder in a bowl or jar. Mix for 2 mins and let it sit for 15 minutes to allow it to dissolve. Then add &frac12; cup of all-purpose flour and mix. We are looking for a thick pancake batter consistency, add a little more flour if needed to get it. Cover it with cling wrap and put it in a semi-warm place: oven with the light on is a safe bet and works all year long; just don&rsquo;t turn on the oven accidentally. Kitchen countertop may work if your AC is not set too high, avoid direct sunlight.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 2: </strong>Just stir vigorously, re-cover with cling wrap and back to the semi-warm place.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We want a thick starter, pancake batter like consistency. </strong>From now on, slowly mix in the water second and add enough water to end up with a full hydrated and thick consistency.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 3: </strong>You might see bubbles or even a bit of sour smell. Add &frac12; cup of all-purpose flour and up to &frac12; cup water, mix everything well and back to the semi-warm place.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 4: </strong>Add &frac12;<strong> </strong>cup flour and up to &frac12; cup water and mix well. Back to the semi-warm place.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 5: </strong>Your starter should be showing signs of life now. To avoid your starter growing exponentially with each feeding, dump half of the starter into the garbage. Then add 1 cup flour to the bowl and up to 1 cup water, mix well and back to the semi-warm place.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 6:</strong> Add &frac12; cup flour and upto &frac12; cup water, mix well and back to semi-warm place.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 7: </strong>At this point, you probably have a full active starter. You can tell by the bubbles, the smell and after discarding and feeding the starter, it should at least double in size over the next 6-8 hours. After it doubles, it will start to shrink again. This is normal, don&rsquo;t panic!</p>
<p>Now you have to decide how much starter you would like to keep, this would depend on your baking needs and recipes that you follow. I tend to keep a minimum of 50 g of starter so that I can feed when I want to bake and make sure that I have at least 50 g of starter remaining after baking for future use.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How to discard and feed and maintain your starter.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #333232;">Your starter will like to be fed a 1:1:1 ratio of starter flour and water. For example, we will assume you will also like to keep 50 grams of sourdough starter in reserve. Get a clean jar that you will be using to store your starter long term. Pro tip: weigh the empty jar and note down the weight, this will make your life easier when you have to discard excess starter when you are feeding. I am using grams because that&rsquo;s what your recipes will likely use, if you want to use cup as your unit of measurement, that is fine as well as long as you are feeding 1:1:1 ratio.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333232;">In a clean glass jar, add 50 grams of sourdough starter, 50 g of all-purpose flour and 50 grams of water.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333232;">Let it set in a semi-warm place. It should double-triple in size over the next 6-8 hours and then will shrink.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333232;">The starter is ready to bake when it has at least doubled in size.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333232;">After you take out the starter you need for baking, make sure you have the minimum amount you have chosen remaining.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333232;"><strong>Maintaining your Sourdough Starter</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333232;">If you bake a lot:&nbsp; Keep in on the counter</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #333232;">If you bake infrequently: Keep in the fridge and feed once weekly.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #333232;"><strong>How to discard and feed:&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333232;">Now you have a jar of super active starter and you want to bake again. Since we know you will need to feed in a 1:1:1 ratio, discard all but 50 grams of starter from your jar. This is where knowing the weight of the empty jar helps. Empty jar weight + 50 grams = what your jar + starter should weigh after discarding excess.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333232;">Then add 50 gram all-purpose flour, 50 g grams water and mix and let it sit in a semi-warm place. It will at least double in size over the next 6-8 hours and is ready to bake.&nbsp;</span></p>
